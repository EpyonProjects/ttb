TTB: Reborn - a rebirth of Zoey's TTB for 1.16+

https://tempestsbox.github.io

### Troubleshooting and Reporting Issues
Before reporting: Try if you can reproduce your issue when using a freshly setup world using the latest version of Minecraft in vanilla, TTB: Reborn (with default configuration), and no other data packs. This can already give insights on whether your version (TTB: Reborn actively supports 1.16+) or another data pack is involved in the issue.
When reporting: You can submit a bug report through the [issue tracker](https://github.com/tempestsbox/ttb/issues).
